This is a port of [VCR](http://github.com/vcr/vcr) for ruby.

Record your test suite's HTTP interactions and replay them during future test runs for fast, deterministic, accurate tests.

Disclaimer: Doing this in PHP is not as easy as in programming languages which support monkey patching (I'm looking at you, Ruby) â€“ this project is not yet fully tested, so please use at your own risk!

## Features

* Automatically records and replays your HTTP(s) interactions with minimal setup/configuration code.
* Supports common http functions and extensions
  * everyting using [streamWrapper](http://php.net/manual/en/class.streamwrapper.php): fopen(), fread(), file_get_contents(), ... without any modification
  * [SoapClient](http://www.php.net/manual/en/soapclient.soapclient.php) by adding `\VCR\VCR\turnOn();` in your `tests/boostrap.php`
  * curl(), by adding `\VCR\VCR::turnOn();` in your `tests/boostrap.php`
* The same request can receive different responses in different tests--just use different cassettes.
* Disables all HTTP requests that you don't explicitly allow (except SoapClient if not configured).
* Request matching is configurable based on HTTP method, URI, host, path, body and headers, or you can easily
  implement a custom request matcher to handle any need.
* The recorded requests and responses are stored on disk in a serialization format of your choice
  (currently YAML and JSON are built in, and you can easily implement your own custom serializer)
* Supports PHPUnit annotations.
* Todo: Recorded requests and responses can easily be inspected and edited.
* Todo: Automatically filters confidential or private information like passwords, auth tokens and emails.
* Todo: Automatically re-records cassettes on a configurable regular interval to keep them fresh and current.
* Todo: Has a good documentation ;-)

## Usage example

Using static method calls:

``` php
class VCRTest extends \PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
    public function testShouldInterceptStreamWrapper()
    {
        // After turning on the VCR will intercept all requests
        VCR::turnOn();

        // Record requests and responses in cassette file 'example'
        VCR::insertCassette('example');

        // Following request will be recorded once and replayed in future test runs
        $result = file_get_contents('http://example.com');
        $this->assertNotEmpty($result);

        // To stop recording requests, eject the cassette
        VCR::eject();

        // Turn off VCR to stop intercepting requests
        VCR::turnOff();
    }

    public function testShouldThrowExceptionIfNoCasettePresent()
    {
        $this->setExpectedException(
            'BadMethodCallException',
            "Invalid http request. No cassette inserted. Please make sure to insert "
            . "a cassette in your unit test using VCR::insertCassette('name');"
        );
        VCR::turnOn();
        // If there is no cassette inserted, a request throws an exception
        file_get_contents('http://example.com');
    }
}
```

You can use annotations in PHPUnit by using [phpunit-testlistener-vcr](https://github.com/php-vcr/phpunit-testlistener-vcr):
``` php
class VCRTest extends \PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
    /**
     * @vcr unittest_annotation_test
     */
    public function testInterceptsWithAnnotations()
    {
        // Requests are intercepted and stored into  tests/fixtures/unittest_annotation_test.
        $result = file_get_contents('http://google.com');

        $this->assertEquals('This is a annotation test dummy.', $result, 'Call was not intercepted (using annotations).');

        // VCR is automatically turned on and off.
    }
}
```

## Installation

Add php-vcr to your `composer.json`.

``` json
  "php-vcr/php-vcr": "dev-master"
```
``` bash
composer install
```

## Dependencies

PHP-VCR depends on:

  * PHP 5.3+
  * Curl extension
  * HTTP library [Guzzle](http://guzzlephp.org)
  * [symfony/yaml](https://github.com/symfony/yaml)
  * [beberlei/assert](https://github.com/beberlei/assert)

Composer installs all dependencies except extensions like curl.

## Run tests

In order to run all tests you need to get development dependencies using composer:

``` php
composer install --dev
phpunit ./tests
```
